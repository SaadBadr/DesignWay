# Design Way

Built over [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)

## Getting Started

- Install Nodejs from the official [Nodejs page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open your terminal and navigate to the `DesignWay` directory
- Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies
- Run `npm run serve` to start a local development server

You can also run additional tasks such as

- `npm run build` to build your app for production
- `npm run lint` to run linting.

## Vue-cli

Using the latest 3.x [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) which aims to reduce project configuration
to as little as possible. Almost everything is inside `package.json` + some other related files such as
`.babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js` and `.postcssrc.js`.

## Vuetify

Vuetify is an Open Source UI Library that is developed exactly according to Material Design spec. Every component is handcrafted to bring you the best possible UI tools to your next great app. The development doesn't stop at the core components outlined in Google's spec. Through the support of community members and sponsors, additional components will be designed and made available for everyone to enjoy.

The documentation for **Vuetify** is hosted [here](https://vuetifyjs.com/).
